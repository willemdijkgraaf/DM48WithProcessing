# DM48WithProcessing
Prototyping feasibility of improving playability of DM48 MIDI harmonica using Processing and MidiBus

The DM48 is a MIDI harmonica produced by LekholmInstruments.
Mini PitchBender is a product by Brendan Power to add simple pitch bending capabilities to the DM48 using a seperate pitch bending USB MIDI device

This project has the following goals:
- Improve playability: using the mini pitch bender as a slide system that feels and acts as a regular chromatic harmonica slide
- Improve playability: reduce amount of glitches (short unintended notes) by using slide position to control NoteOn/NoteOff
- Improve playability: reduce amount of glitches (short unintended notes) by using slide position to dampen breath control values
- Improve musicality: adding harmonization
- Improve playability: in case breath controller is used with orchestral patches, breath sensitivity is too high and should be smoothed out for more natural sounding results


And much more to come.
